                <p>Our water district was founded in unincorporated King County in 1960, the nearest city being Kent. 
                    Nearly all of the system was annexed into Auburn in 2008. We currently serve 59 homes in the neighborhood, stretching 4
                    houses east and west of 118th Ave from SE 280th St to SE 288th St. Bylaws restrict service to 1 service-line hookup per lot.
                </p>
                <p> The well and pumphouse is located on the
                    corner of 118th Ave and SE 282nd, and contains
                    our water treatment system and a diesel
                    generator which kicks on automatically in the
                    event of a power outage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our water is tested weekly. Water quality reports
                    are done on a regular basis and sent to
                    residents annually. Reach out to the Secretary if
                    you did not receive one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of 2024 we are in the process of a complete
                    upgrade to the overall water distribution system,
                    for the first time in over 60 years. This is
                    designed to improve service reliability and
                    quality.</p>

                <h2>Recent water system updates</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Starting July 3rd, we started to have low water pressure in the system. Nothing at the pump house appeared
                        to be wrong. Over the next couple days, we continued to have low pressure, and the reservior was 
                        found to be low. We called Northwest Water Service (NWS) out to help 2 leaks that were identified. The first 
                        was a small leak on a lateral line between two homes on the west end of 282nd st. The second leak was large. While
                        nearly all of our lines run in the right of way next to the streets, we do have one line that was put along a
                        back fence line at the north edge of the system. Currently that area is covered with blackberries, so it
                        can be difficult to know if we have a leak in that line. <br>
                        We did indeed have a break back there, a union had been eroded over time by a small leak, and now it was
                        leaking a lot. You can see the union and the blackberries covering this area below.
                    </li>

                    <img src="images/blackberries_july_25.jpg" >
                
                    <li>
                        July 9,10: We've been having problems with our chlorine pump; it stopped adding chlorine. NWS was out for a couple days,
                        and was able to rebuild the pump. So Chlorine levels are back to normal.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Main replacement project status</h2>
                <p >Association Board approved three motions this last year. The first was to request a loan from the State of Washington 
                    through the Perpetual Water fund to fund Northwest Water Services to create a plan to replace our aging water 
                    system. The reasons are two fold:
                </p>
                <h4>Breaks are more frequent and more expensive</h4>
                <p >
                    First, we have many more breaks in the system than we previously did, and the materials that were using in the 1950'
                    to build the system are not up to the standards of today.
                </p>
                <img src="images/old_vs_new_pipe.jpg" alt="system aerial map" width="400" height="100">
                <h4>Water Loss</h4>

                <p >
                    The second reason is that we lose about 30% of the water that we pump from the ground through leaks
                    in the system, which is wasteful, costs us extra electricity to pump, and is not in compliance with
                    state standards. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project plan has been completed, and we are in the process of getting bids from companies at this time.
                </p>
                <h4>Project Plan Funding</h4>
                <p >
                    The second motion that was passed was to pursue a State of Washington Perpetual Water Fund low interest loan. We 
                    received a loan last year to fund the project plan, and the loan would allow us to fund the replacement system. The 
                    loan application should be submitted in October 2024.
                </p>
                <h4>Federal Grant identification and application</h4>
                <p>
                    The third motion was to fund the pursuit of federal grants to cover some of the cost of the replacement. We have been working
                    with a grant writing company who specializes in identifying and preparing the grant submission paperwork. We are in the process
                    of applying for a grant that would cover up to 50% of the cost. Current costs are estimated to be over $1,000,000, so we are 
                    hopeful that a grant is approved. The grant application will be submitted prior to Oct 7, 2024.
                </p>
                <h4>Status 7/11/2025</h4>
                <p>
                    All government grants were put on hold at the beginning of the year, so we were not able to secure a grant.
                    Our loan was not approved by the State of Washington. The board is looking at alternative plans to be able to 
                    do the project incrementally.
